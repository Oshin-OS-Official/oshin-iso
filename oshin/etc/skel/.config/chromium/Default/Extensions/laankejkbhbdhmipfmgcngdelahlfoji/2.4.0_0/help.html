            <h3>What is StayFocusd?</h3>
            <p>
              StayFocusd is an extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay
              focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend
              browsing time-wasting websites. Once your allotted time for the
              day has been used up, the sites you have blocked will be
              inaccessible until the next day.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Why do I need StayFocusd?</h3>
            <p>Because you're human.</p>
            <p>
              You sit down at the computer, and you swear you'll be productive.
              Next thing you know, it's twelve hours later. You've checked your
              email, updated your Facebook status, browsed the trending topics
              on Twitter, read your RSS feeds, looked up your favorite band on
              Wikipedia, vanity googled yourself, cyber-stalked your ex, your
              ex's lover, and several high-school crushes, and lost a week's pay
              playing online poker.
            </p>
            <p>What you haven't done is <i>WORK.</i></p>
            <p>
              The fact is, it's very hard to stay focused on work or school when
              you have all the world's information, news, music, and
              *cough*porn*cough* at your fingertips. Sometimes self-control is
              in short supply, and you need a little help keeping on track.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <p>
              StayFocusd adds an icon to your browser, to the right of the
              address bar. Clicking it will display a popup window with one
              primary option:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Block this entire site:</strong> This will block you
                  from browsing <i>any page</i> on the current site once time
                  runs out. For example, if you block cnn.com, it will block all
                  pages on cnn.com, www.cnn.com, politics.cnn.com,
                  www.cnn.com/some-article-title, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can also click Advanced Options to expose more specific
              options for blocking and allowing the domain. Let's use
              politics.cnn.com as an example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Allow this entire site:</strong> This will allow you
                  to browse every page on the current site, even after time runs
                  out.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Only block pages on politics.cnn.com:</strong> This
                  will prevent you from browsing <i>only</i> pages on the
                  current subdomain. If you block politics.cnn.com, you will
                  still be allowed to browse sportsillustrated.cnn.com, as well
                  as www.cnn.com and cnn.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>NOTE: </i> If you only block www.cnn.com, you will still be
                  able to access cnn.com ... which kind of defeats the purpose
                  of blocking the site. This option should only be used to block
                  subdomains other than www.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Only allow pages on politics.cnn.com:</strong> This
                  will allow you to browse pages on the current subdomain, even
                  if the rest of the domain is blocked. For example, you may
                  want to block yourself from the entire cnn.com website
                  <i>except</i> politics.cnn.com.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Enter a custom url:</strong> This will allow you to
                  block or allow any specific page, path, or query. For example,
                  you may want to block yourself from Google Reader, at
                  google.com/reader. Entering this custom url and clicking
                  "Block custom url" will block your access to google.com/reader
                  without preventing you from accessing any other Google url for
                  search, email, docs, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Likewise, you can use the custom url to allow only a specific
                  path while preventing access to the rest of a domain. For
                  example, you may choose to block the entire Delicious site at
                  delicious.com. However, if you want to use Delicious to
                  bookmark a site, you'll need to allow access to
                  delicious.com/save. Entering delicious.com/save into the
                  custom url field and clicking "Allow custom url" will let you
                  use Delicious for bookmarking while still blocking other
                  delicious.com pages.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I enable StayFocusd in Incognito mode?</h3>
            <p>
              Click Chrome's Wrench icon (top right, below close button), then
              Tools > Extensions. Look for the StayFocusd extension, and check
              the "Allow in incognito" checkbox.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              Is there any way to remove the ability to disable/uninstall the
              extension?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, no. Chrome extensions can not remove the disable or
              uninstall options. I do have a request in to the Chrome developers
              to add this ability, but I don't expect them to implement my
              request (ever).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, you CAN prevent yourself from accessing the extensions
              settings page by adding chrome://extensions to your Blocked Sites
              list. Once your time is up, you won't be able to access the
              settings to disable StayFocusd.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              Can you make this extension work for other browsers? Is there a
              version for my phone? Can it block desktop software or other
              Chrome apps?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I wish. Extensions only work in Chrome or Edge -- they can't
              affect any other software, browsers, devices, or Chrome
              apps/extensions. If you find yourself using other browsers to
              cheat, your best bet is to uninstall them. Or you can delete the
              shortcuts from your desktop, quick start, start menu, etc. Making
              it more inconvenient to boot up another browser may help curtail
              the urge to cheat.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can download the Microsoft Edge version of StayFocusd

              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another alternative is to use another app like

            <h3>
              How do I stop the update notice (NEW badge on StayFocusd icon)
              from being displayed every time StayFocusd updates?
            </h3>
            <p>
              You can disable the update notice in the Customize section of the

            <h1>Max Allowed Time Per Day</h1>

            <h3>Can I change the amount of time I'm allowed per day?</h3>
            <p>
              Sure, as long as your time for the day hasn't run out yet. Just
              visit the <a href="options.html">Options</a> page and enter the
              number of minutes per day you want to allow yourself. If your time
              has run out for the day, you'll have to wait until tomorrow before
              you can update your settings.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Can I set different time limits for different websites?</h3>
            <p>
              At the moment, no. However, it's the #1 most requested feature, so
              it may be added in the future. Don't hold your breath though.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>How do I know how much time I have left?</h3>
            <p>
              Clicking the StayFocusd icon in your browser will open a popup
              window with a display of the amount of time you have left for the
              day. If you are currently on a blocked site, the timer will
              actively count down how much time is remaining. If you're on an
              allowed site, or a site which is neither blocked nor allowed, then
              the countdown will be paused.
            </p>
            <p>
              When your time is almost up, a small countdown timer will appear
              superimposed over the StayFocusd icon. It will count down the last
              60 seconds, first with a yellow background, then turning red when
              you're down to the last 30 seconds.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>What happens when I'm out of time?</h3>
            <p>
              Once you use up your allotted time for the day, you will not be
              able to access any of the sites you have blocked. If you try to
              access a blocked site, you will be redirected to the StayFocusd
              website, where you will be made to feel very guilty for trying to
              waste time when you should be working.
            </p>

            <h3>
              When will I be allowed to browse blocked sites again, once my time
              has run out?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Your allotted time will be reset once per date, at the Daily Reset
              Time. If you use up all your time early in the day, then you'll
              have to wait until the Daily Reset Time passes before you can
              browse blocked sites again.
            </p>

            <h3>
              How come every time I try to change the Max Allowed Time, it just
              reverts back to the previous value?
            </h3>
            <p>
              At some point you probably clicked the "Prevent this page from
              creating additional dialogs" checkbox on one of the popups
              StayFocusd displays when you change your time. Try closing all
              Chrome windows, then restart Chrome. That should fix the issue.

              StayFocusd is already set to be active for the current day, you

            <h3>What is the Daily Reset Time?</h3>
            <p>
              StayFocusd gives you a limited amount of time per day to browse
              blocked websites. Once per day, the timer is reset, and your Time
              Remaining countdown is restored. The Daily Reset Time allows you
              to customize the time that this reset happens.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>What's the best Daily Reset Time?</h3>
            <p>
              It depends on your work/sleep habits. By default, the Daily Reset
              Time is set to midnight. However, if you're a night owl who works
              well past midnight, you may not want your timer to reset right in
              the middle of a productive late night. In that case, you can set
              the timer to reset in the very early morning, like 5:00 AM.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              Why do I have to wait 24 hours before changes to the Daily Reset
              Time go into effect?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The delay is there to prevent you from using the Daily Reset Time
              to cheat. If the setting took effect instantly, you could easily
              set the reset time to one minute after your Time Remaining runs
              out, therefore allowing continued access to blocked sites.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              It looks like my time didn't reset -- it's still zero and I
              haven't even visited any blocked sites yet! What did I do wrong?
            </h3>
            <p>
              This can sometimes happen if your Daily Reset Time is between your
              Active Hours (i.e. your Active Hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and
              your Daily Reset Time is 4:00 PM.)
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this problem, set your Daily Reset Time to a time after
              the end of your Active Hours. Using the example above, setting the
              Daily Reset Time to 5:01 PM would solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that it might take 24 hours for this solution to take effect.

            <h1>The Nuclear Option</h1>

            <h3>What is the Nuclear Option?</h3>
            <p>
              The Nuclear Option is a way for you to block access to the entire
              Internet (optionally excluding your Allowed Sites) for as many
              hours as you specify. You can set it to start immediately, to kick
              in once you have exceeded your Max Time Allowed, or to start at a
              scheduled time. It can be set to run just today, every week day,
              or every single day. It can block entire sites, or just selected
              content: multimedia, forms, logins, and/or images.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>What are some good ways to use the Nuclear Option?</h3>
            <p>
              The most obvious use is to help you stay focused when you have a
              deadline approaching, whether it's a project for work, a homework
              assignment, a school test. Set the Nuclear Option for several
              hours starting right now, and all your attention can go towards
              the task at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can also help people who find themselves staying up way too
              late goofing around on the Internet instead of sleeping. Set the
              Nuclear Option to kick in for a few hours every day around your
              bedtime, and you can break yourself of the late-night web surfing
              habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're the type of person who loses a lot of time playing games
              on Facebook or watching videos on sites like YouTube or Hulu,
              blocking multimedia will prevent you from accessing that content.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're the type who obsessively checks email, reads Facebook
              messages, or posts in forums or blog comments, blocking forms can
              help break you of that habit. Or you can just block logins, which
              will prevent you from entering a password on any sites that
              require a login. If you can't log in, you can't waste time there.
            </p>
            <p>
              (If there are other ways that the Nuclear Option has helped you,
              email
              <a href="mailto:support@stayfocusd.com">support@stayfocusd.com</a>
              and I'll add them to this list.)

            <h3>How can I cancel the Nuclear Option?</h3>
            <p>
              You can't. That's why it's called the Nuclear Option. Once you
              push that button, there's no turning back. You have to wait until
              the hours you entered expire. You can find the expiration
              date/time on the
              <a href="options.html#nuclearOptionTab">Options</a> page.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Can I change the Nuclear Option once it's active?</h3>
            <p>
              That depends. If you want to change the settings to make the
              Nuclear Option more restrictive (i.e. going from blocking just
              your blocked sites to blocking all sites), then yes. However, if
              you want to make the Nuclear Option more lenient, then no. You'll
              have to wait until the Nuclear Option expires before making the
              settings more lenient.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Can I set the Nuclear Option for less than an hour?</h3>
            <p>
              Originally, no. However, some people pointed out they'd like to
              use the Nuclear Option for the
              <a
                href="https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"
                target="_blank"
                >Pomodoro Technique</a
              >, so I made it possible to enter decimals. For example, if you
              want 30 minutes, just enter 0.5.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Why does the Time Remaining box in the popup say "nuclear"?</h3>
            <p>That means that the Nuclear Option is in effect.</p>

            <h3>
              How do I know when the Nuclear Option expires so I can begin
              browsing websites again?
            </h3>
            <p>
              You can find the expiration date/time on the
              <a href="options.html#nuclearOptionTab">Options</a> page. If the
              nuclear option is active, the expiration date/time will be shown
              in red.

            <hr />

            <h3>
              How does the Nuclear Option work in relation to my Active Days and
              Active Hours?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It's completely unrelated. The Nuclear Option is typically used in
              special circumstances outside your normal day-to-day workflow, so
              it goes by its own rules.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>How can I tell that the Nuclear Option is active?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, the most obvious way is by seeing sites being blocked. You
              can also tell by the StayFocusd icon, which will turn into a
              yellow "radioactive" icon when the Nuclear Option is active. Also,
              the timer in the StayFocusd popup will read "nuclear."
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              Can you give me a warning before the Nuclear Option kicks in?
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you set the Nuclear Option to start at a specific time, then
              you will get a desktop notification 5 minutes, 1 minutes, and 10
              seconds before the Nuclear Option starts blocking sites.

            <hr />

            <h3>
              I set the Nuclear Option to block images, but not all images are
              blocked. What gives?
            </h3>
            <p>
              StayFocusd blocks img tags, which is what most sites use for
              images. However, some images -- such as the thumbnails in Facebook
              photo galleries -- are displayed using the background-image css
              property. Blocking that requires processing that could slow down
              some websites, so I'm letting those slip.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>
              How come I can still catch a glimpse of images/video/etc. before
              StayFocusd blocks them?
            </h3>
            <p>
              StayFocusd has to wait until the page finishes loading before
              looking for images to block. Some sites load more slowly than
              others, resulting in a small lag between the image being loaded
              and StayFocusd being able to block it. I'll keep looking for ways
              to make this faster though -- it might be possible to find a
              clever solution.

            <p>
              If you minimize the browser or switch to another program,
              StayFocusd will continue to deduct from your allotted time for up
              to 5 minutes. If there is no activity in your browser -- no typing
              and no mouse movement -- after 5 minutes, then the site will be
              visually blocked with an overlay asking if you're still there. As
              long as this overlay is visible, the countdown will be paused and
              no additional time will be deducted. When you return to the site
              after being away, you can clear the overlay by clicking a link or
              pressing any key. At that point, the countdown will resume.

              When the site is allowed, the icon will turn green. If the site is
              neither blocked nor allowed, the icon will remain blue.

            <p>
              StayFocusd does this by default, using Chrome's built-in sync
              feature. You must be signed into Chrome in order for this to work.
              You can sign in by clicking the Wrench icon and selecting "Sign in

              Just check the Disable Sync box in the Customize tab on the

            <p>
              Note that the Disable Sync setting itself doesn't get synced, so
              you'll need to disable sync on each computer you don't want to

              StayFocusd will add whatever sites are on your local computer's
              lists to the lists stored by Chrome Sync. If you have sync enabled
              on other devices, this will result in your local sites showing up

            <p>
              In general, StayFocusd is designed to prevent you from changing
              your settings to give yourself more time. However, if you really
              want to make it hard on yourself, you can turn on the
              <a href="options.html#requireChallengeTab">Require Challenge</a>

            <h3>What is the "difficult, but not impossible" challenge?</h3>
            <p>
              When Require Challenge is turned on, you will be required to type
              a short paragraph into a text box. The catch is, you must type it
              perfectly, letter-for-letter, from start to finish, without making
              a single mistake. That means no typos, no backspace, no delete, no
              cut-and-paste. If you mistype even one letter, the whole thing
              blanks out, and you have to start over.

              Is there any way to bypass the challenge so I can start the
              Nuclear Option or reduce my Maximum Time Allowed?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When the Require Challenge overlay appears, look in the lower
              right corner for a link that reads, "I want to change settings so
              I can be more productive". Clicking that will let you access a
              limited subset of options -- only those which will limit your
              browsing more, not less.

              I accidentally clicked Require Challenge -- how do I turn it off?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There's no way to disable the challenge without completing it
              successfully.

            <h3>Can I customize the text in the Require Challenge box?</h3>
            <p>
              You can, but your custom text must be at least as long as the
              default challenge text, and it must be
              <strong>in English</strong>. It must also be sufficiently complex
              -- you can't just enter a long string of "aaaaaaaaaaaaa" and
              expect it to work. To customize the challenge, visit the
              <a href="options.html#requireChallengeTab">Options</a> page.
